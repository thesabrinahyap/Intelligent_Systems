# clustering-algorithms
This will be the activities for the report of Joshua Kuizon and Jomar Leano about clustering Algorithms.

You have two tasks:

I.    
      Using the  dataset  "Mall_Customers.csv" and the test_HDBSCAN.ipynb, Run the code and adjust the  min_cluster_size to 3, 5 and 9 in the 
      HDBSCAN clustering model. After that analyse the different results of the clusters after running the codes
      
II.   
      You have been provided with a dataset named "cereal_activty.csv," which contains various attributes related to different cereal products. 
      Your  task is to compare the performance of two clustering algorithms: OPTICS(Ordering Points To Identify Clustering Structure) and DBSCAN 
      (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise).
